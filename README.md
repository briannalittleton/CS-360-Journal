Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
For the inventory app, its major components are warehouse, inventory, and items. The functionality that will be necessary based on this application is tracking everything in the warehouse and making sure is it updated.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Screens and features that were necessary for user needs were:
1.A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords
2.A screen for logging into the app
3.A screen with a grid that displays all items in the inventory
4.A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from the inventory
5.A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory
6.A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to zero

My UI designs kept users in mind because we wanted to create something that was simple and easy to manage. My designs were succesful because It can accompolish the users goals/taasks.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached the process od coding my app in a timely manner, I didn't want to rush through it at all. Those techniques can be applied in the future because it can provide us with the most accurate outcome.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my code and if there were errors I fixed them. This process is important because it revealed what I needed to work and spend more time on.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate where I placed my code because in the beginning I was a little confusfed about the layout.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I would say in the planning aspect i was succeeful in the most because I layed out everything how I wanted it to be and it wind up working fine.
